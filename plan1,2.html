CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan
<p>
Name: Caitlin Parker
<p>
Goals
<br>
	To have an increase of customers by at least 50%, and to have an increase of the younger audience and families.
<p>
Success Evaluation
<br>
	2 months before the website is launched take an attendence roll each week with everyone's ages, to get the total of partipants and age groups of players.
	Repeat for the first 2 months of the launch of the website.
<br>Compare the two statistics and identify if there is an increase of partipants of at least 50% and an increase of younger members or families.
<p>
Target Audience
<br>
	A younger audience between the ages 15-30
<br>
	To appeal to this audience, a more modern flat design will be utilised. The main colour scheme will be orange, as to give a warm beach feel mainly associated with volleyball, with blue as an accent to contrast.
	These pop of colours will grab the attention and appeal to the younger audience, making it feel youthful, playful and welcoming to new members and beginners of volleyball.
